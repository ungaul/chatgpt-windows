# ü§ñ ChatGPT Windows Automation Script

This AutoIt script allows you to quickly interact with ChatGPT by selecting text from any application and sending it to ChatGPT. The script runs in the background, pastes the selected text into ChatGPT, copies the response, and pastes it back into the clipboard for easy access.

üîó **GitHub Repository:** [ungaul/chatgpt-windows](https://github.com/ungaul/chatgpt-windows)

## üöÄ Features

- **Select and Send**: Select text in any window, press `Ctrl + Shift + G`, and the text will be sent to ChatGPT.
- **Clipboard Response**: The response from ChatGPT is automatically copied to your clipboard for easy access.
- **Hotkey to Close**: You can close the script and the ChatGPT window anytime by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + H`.
- **Runs in Background**: The ChatGPT window is moved off-screen, so the process runs invisibly without disturbing your workspace.
